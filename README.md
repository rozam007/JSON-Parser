# JSON-Parser

Basically It is a 2-Step process
1- Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)
2- Parser

Lexical Analysis:
It is a process of breaking down the code into smaller meaningful chunks e.g. keywords, symbols, and literals. It is very essential and it will allow the parser to determine where to start and stop during the parsing process.

Parser:
The parser is where we make sense out of our tokens. Now we have to build our Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the structure and meaning of the code in a hierarchical tree-like structure. It captures the relationships between different elements of the code, such as statements, expressions, and declarations.
